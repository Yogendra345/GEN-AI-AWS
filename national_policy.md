Policy Pillar 1: Governance & Constitutional Framework
1.1. Form of Government
The Republic of WantonSoup shall be a unitary sovereign democratic republic, governed under the supremacy of a written Constitution.
The three branches of government — Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary — shall function as co-equal guardians of the Constitution, each operating within powers explicitly granted and restrained by law.

Executive Authority shall rest in the President of the Republic, elected by direct popular vote for a term of five years, renewable once. The President shall be both Head of State and Head of Government.

Legislative Authority shall rest in the National Assembly of WantonSoup, a unicameral body of 250 members elected through proportional representation.

Judicial Authority shall rest in the Supreme Court of WantonSoup and such subordinate courts as established by law.

1.2. Fundamental Constitutional Principles
The governance of WantonSoup shall be grounded in the following principles:

Sovereignty of the People  All authority emanates from the people, exercised through their elected representatives or directly via constitutional mechanisms such as referendums.

Rule of Law  No individual, institution, or branch of government is above the law.

Transparency and Accountability  All government actions shall be open to public scrutiny except where national security requires confidentiality.

Decentralization of Administration  While the nation remains unitary, provincial and municipal councils shall be empowered to make localized decisions.

Merit-Based Public Service Recruitment, promotion, and tenure in public service shall be based strictly on merit, competence, and integrity.

1.3. Checks and Balances
To prevent abuse of power:

The President may veto legislation, but such vetoes may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the National Assembly.

The National Assembly may impeach the President for high crimes or gross misconduct by a three-fourths vote, subject to trial by the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court may review laws and executive acts for constitutionality.

1.4. Anti-Corruption Framework
The Republic shall establish a National Integrity Commission vested with:

Power to investigate corruption across all branches of government.

Authority to prosecute offenses independently of the Attorney-General.

Mandate to enforce annual asset declarations for all public officials.

Whistleblower protection laws ensuring confidentiality and safety.

1.5. Electoral System and Political Rights
Universal Suffrage shall be granted to all citizens aged 18 and above.

Elections shall be supervised by an Independent Electoral Commission.

Political parties must be registered, internally democratic, and financially transparent.

Campaign financing shall be capped, and foreign funding is prohibited.

1.6. Civil Service and Administrative Law
The Civil Service Charter shall define rights, duties, and ethical obligations of public servants.

Administrative decisions must be reasoned, documented, and subject to judicial review.

A National School of Governance shall train civil servants in public policy, ethics, and leadership.

1.7. Public Consultation and Citizen Participation
Major policy decisions shall be subject to public consultation periods.

Citizens may propose legislation through a petition signed by at least 2% of the electorate.

A National Ombudsman Office shall receive complaints from citizens regarding maladministration.

1.8. Emergency Powers
The President may declare a national emergency only with the concurrence of a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly.

All emergency measures must be proportional, time-bound, and subject to judicial review.

1.9. Constitutional Amendment Process
Amendments require a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly and ratification by a national referendum.

No amendment shall abridge fundamental rights, alter the democratic form of government, or extend presidential terms beyond the constitutional limit.

1.10. Symbolic Commitments
The Constitution shall enshrine the National Flag, National Anthem, and National Emblem as symbols of unity.

The government shall designate a Founders' Day to commemorate the nation's establishment.
