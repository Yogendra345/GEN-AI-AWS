 ABCSoftware - Human Resources (HR) Policy-V1.3
Preamble
The Human Resources (HR) Policy of [Organization Name] defines the guiding principles and procedures for effective management of our people. This policy ensures fair, consistent, and legally compliant practices to cultivate a productive, respectful, and welcoming workplace. We recognize our employees as our greatest asset and are committed to creating an environment that attracts, develops, and retains talent while supporting our mission, values, and strategic objectives.

1. Recruitment and Selection
The organization is committed to a transparent, merit-based recruitment process that welcomes qualified candidates aligned with our values and job requirements. This policy applies to all forms of employment, whether permanent, contractual, part-time, or temporary. HR will work with department heads annually to assess workforce needs and maintain current job descriptions. Vacancies are advertised both internally and externally to promote equal opportunity, and the selection process includes structured interviews, competency assessments, and background checks. All recruitment shall comply with non-discrimination laws to avoid any bias regarding age, gender, race, religion, or disability. Offer letters are provided only after all necessary approvals.

2. Onboarding and Induction
We strive to integrate new hires smoothly into our culture and processes. Upon joining, HR provides offer confirmation, joining instructions, and a list of required documents. New employees participate in an orientation program introducing our history, values, structure, key policies, IT systems, and safety procedures. All new employees serve a probationary period of three to six months, with formal reviews at 30, 60, and 90 days. A workplace buddy is assigned for the first month to assist in acclimatization.

3. Employee Classification and Contracts
Employees are classified into permanent, fixed-term contract, part-time, and internships or traineeships. Each employment contract clearly states the role, pay, benefits, working hours, probation period, and termination clauses, in compliance with applicable labor laws.

4. Compensation and Benefits
Salaries are defined by job grade, market benchmarks, and internal equity and are reviewed annually. Employees receive health insurance for themselves and eligible dependents, retirement benefits according to statutory requirements, paid leave entitlements (annual, sick, maternity/paternity, and compassionate), and access to an Employee Assistance Program for mental wellbeing. Salaries are processed monthly with electronic payslips, and statutory deductions are made as per legal requirements.

5. Working Hours, Attendance, and Leave
The standard workweek is [e.g., 40 hours, Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 6 PM], with flexible work arrangements available with managerial approval. Attendance is tracked electronically; staff must clock in and out. Uninformed absences beyond three days may lead to disciplinary action. Leave entitlements include a set number of annual and sick days, with additional leave for maternity/paternity in accordance with the law. Unpaid leave is possible with approval.

6. Performance Management
We aim to fairly evaluate performance, aligning individual goals with the organization's objectives. Annual goals are set collaboratively and formally reviewed mid-year, with an annual appraisal focusing on key performance indicators, competencies, and behaviors. Performance improvement plans are available for underperforming staff, with defined timelines and support.

7. Learning and Development
The organization invests in employee growth through ongoing training and development opportunities. Training needs are assessed each year, and both internal and external programs are provided. High-potential employees benefit from career development plans, and tuition assistance is available for approved studies.

8. Employee Conduct and Discipline
Employees must demonstrate integrity, respect, and professionalism at all times. Disciplinary procedures follow a progressive process from verbal to written to final warning, then termination as appropriate, with immediate dismissal possible for gross misconduct such as fraud, violence, or harassment. There is zero tolerance for harassment, bullying, or discrimination; complaints will be investigated confidentially.

9. Health, Safety, and Welfare
[Organization Name] complies with all Occupational Health and Safety laws. Annual risk assessments are conducted and first aid facilities and emergency procedures are maintained. Employees are encouraged to participate in wellness programs, including annual health check-ups, fitness subsidies, and mental health initiatives.

10. Exit and Termination
When an employee voluntarily resigns, the required notice period (typically one month) must be served, and an exit interview is conducted. Termination by the employer may occur due to performance issues, redundancy, or misconduct; in these cases, notice or payment in lieu is provided per contract. Final settlements cover the return of company property and payment of remaining salary, benefits, and any applicable leave encashment.

Implementation and Review
This HR policy will be reviewed annually by the HR department. Any changes must be approved by both the HR Director and the CEO to ensure ongoing relevance and legal compliance
